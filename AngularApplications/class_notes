- By using AngularJS, we can create two types of applications.

    1. Static Angular Application

    2. Dynamic Angular Application


Static Angular Application:

    - if view won't interacts with the controller for dynamic data,
      then such type of angular application called as static angular
      application.



Dynamic Angular Application:

    - If view interacts with the controller for dynamic data, then such type
      of angular application called as Dynamic Angular Application.



Steps to create the Static Angular Application:
-----------------------------------------------

Step 1:
    create the bower component.

bower.json
----------
{
    "name":"nareshit",
    "dependencies":{
        "angular":"latest"
    }
}


Step 2:
    create the view

Ex.
    index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>
    <input type="number" ng-model="number_one"> <br>br>
    <input type="number" ng-model="number_two"> <br><br>
    <h1 style="color:red" ng-bind="number_one+number_two"></h1>
    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>

- angular framework (angular.min.js) file starts the execution from
  ng-app directive

- logical name of web application optional for static applications.

- "ng-model" directive creates the object in heap memory with application
  data.

- ng-bind directive "binds" the the model data to the view.


Dynamic Angular Application:
----------------------------

Step 1:
    Download angular framework by using bower.

Step 2:
    load the angular framework.

Step 3:
    declare the logical name of web application

   Ex.
        ng-app="app"

   [Note : where "app" is the logical name of web application]


Step 4:
    declare the controller by using "ng-controller" directive.

Ex.

    <div ng-controller="ctrl">

    </div>

[Note : where "ctrl" is the logical name of controller]


Step 5:
    Create the app module.


    var app = angular.module("app",[]);
        (object)             (logical name)

    [Note : with the help of "app" object we can implement the
            controllers, services, filters,...]


Step 6:
    implement the controller.
